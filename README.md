# AnimatedImage for Playdate

The goal of AnimatedImage is to be able to plop in animated images in place of static images easily. No calls to update, etc. In fact, AnimatedImage behaves just like a built-in `playdate.graphics.image`. Any API `playdate.graphics.image` supports so does AnimatedImage, except it operates on the current frame. It does this by forwarding any call to the current frame image. It is more or less a drop-in replacement.

AnimatedImage is less than 100 lines of Lua, and most of that is just boilerplate getter/setter as AnimatedImage sits on top of `playdate.graphics.image` and `playdate.graphics.animation.loop`. Simply replace `playdate.graphics.image.new` with `AnimatedImage.new` to get started, and change the path from a static image to that of an image table or gif.
